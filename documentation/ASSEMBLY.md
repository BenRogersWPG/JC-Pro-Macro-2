# JCPM 2 User Manual (Work-in-Progress)#

Thanks for purchasing a JC Pro Macro 2 assembly kit! While it's possible to solder items in a different order, following  
these steps should make it a bit easier.

## Step 0 ##

The JC Pro macro can be assembled with little more than a soldering iron or screwdriver. That being said, I've developed
several 3D-printable jigs to help in the process, [available here](https://github.com/JeremySCook/JC-Pro-Macro-2/tree/main/3DP-accessories)

## Step 1 Pro Micro Assembly/Text ##

Remove the Pro Micro board from its packaging, plug in to computer and program per [main use manual](https://github.com/JeremySCook/JC-Pro-Macro-2/blob/main/documentation/README.md).  
If done at the beginning, this ensures that your Pro Micro board is working correctly before any potential issues with  
overall assembly. Once successful, solder legs on. It can be helpful to use a breadboard as a jig, or use the 3D-printable  
jig found in the printing directory.

## Step 2 ##

Solder Pro Micro Socket to bottom.

## Step 3 Solder key switches in place. ##

Remove any protective covering, and place keyswitch retainer on top of keyboard PCB if purchased, then place key switches  
in their through holes. Helpful to put in correct through holes upright, cover with a flat object (perhaps a piece of cardboard)  
then flip onto a flat surface. Solder keys, paying attention that everything is aligned correctly, especially if not  
using a retainer.

## Step 4 Solder Mode/Reset buttons and encoder ##

Pop mode/reset buttons into place on top of PCB, along with encoder. Encoder may take some finagling to get all leads
into place, but should fit. Flip and solder. It may be helpful to cut into a box or similar to allow encoder to hang down  
while resting on the keys. Alternatively, one of the printed jigs can be very helpful here.

## Step 4 A Solder Optional OLED Screen ##

Solder female 4-pin header to through-holes on right. Solder rightmost pads to match ghe Vcc/Gnd configuration of OLED  
screen, most commonly: JP4 middle to +, JP3, middle to -.

## Step 5 Mechanical Assembly ##

Most of this is fairly straightforward, however, standoff installation in base involves a press fit that may not be  
immediately evident. First, 

Remove any protective covering. Press all four standoffs in lightly in the side that says "JC Pro Macro 2." Turn over, and  
press each standoff in individually, ensuring they bottom out. Place the assembled PCB on top and screw in, using long screws
over retainer plate.

Press on basic knob, or install premium knob using allen key. Plug in, and if programmed in earlier step, you're good to go!
