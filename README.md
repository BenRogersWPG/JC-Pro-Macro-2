Successfully funded on Kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/291892408/jc-pro-macro-2-mechanical-keypad  
Pre-order now on Tindie (waitlist): https://www.tindie.com/products/jeremycook/jc-pro-macro-2-rotarygpio-macro-keyboard-kit/

**When programming, may need to hit reset button right before upload. Normally this isn't needed
with the Pro Micro, but seems to be a consequence of it being in HID mode. Double-tap reset button
to give yourself more time to program if needed.**

Interactive BOM for .4 Rev found here: https://jeremyscook.github.io/ibom-JCPM2.html. Board dimensions seen below.
Both are subject to change.
