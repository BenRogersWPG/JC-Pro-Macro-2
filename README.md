When programming, will need to hit reset button right before upload. Normally this isn't needed
with the Pro Micro, but seems to be a consequence of it being in HID mode. Double-tap reset button
to give yourself more time to program if needed.

Interactive BOM for .4 Rev found here: https://jeremyscook.github.io/ibom-JCPM2.html. Board dimensions seen below.
Both are subject to change.
